Generates a dynamic list of books from shelfari using SOAP. Configurable, with templates.

== Description ==

[Shelfari](http://shelfari.com/) allows users to list the books they own, as well as books they are currently reading,
for free. They also provide a Flash-based plugin to put on blogs (though this doesn't work with WordPress). However,
for those who prefer a more light-weight and customizable view of the books they are reading (or who just don't like
Flash), there is BookList.

BookList provides a template-based mechanism to display the contents of your Shelfari shelf (or currently reading list,
or top ten) in a customizable widget.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `booklist` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. In your WP admin console, go to Plugins and activate BookList Widget.
1. In your WP admin console, go to Appearance | Widgets and drag BookList to the desired sidebar.
1. Enter your Shelfari username and change any options you care to
1. Click the Save button

== Technical Stuff ==

BookList uses Shelfari's SOAP interface, which is also used by Shelfari's own Flash plugin for blogs.

BookList is based on [WP Audioscrobbler](http://sevennine.net/projects/wp-audioscrobbler/) by Marc Hodges.
